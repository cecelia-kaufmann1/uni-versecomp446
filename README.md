# ü¶Ñ Welcome to the Uni-verse!
![site preview](loginscreen/static/loginscreen/assets/images/site_preview.png)

A capstone project for Macalester College's COMP 446 by [Cecelia Kaufmann](https://github.com/cecelia-kaufmann1), [Lucy Rubin](https://github.com/lucyrubin), and [Linda Lor](https://github.com/LindaLor028)

This interactive web application takes you into the world of unicorns, with the main goal of the unicorn being outrunning the paparazzi to collect sparkles! Then, go spend those sparkles at the store to show off to all your friends! Finally, go chat with other unicorns while you are dressed in your finest attire. 

This project uses the Django Framework to host the login and then a separate server to host the multiplayer/chatroom feature, which is then embedded within the wesbite. The game utilizes the Phaser Framework, and we also used Ajax for asychronous loading. For the front-end framework, we used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## üõ† How To Install Uni-verse:
After cloning the above repository, here are the steps to get the uni-verse up and running. Please run these commands below. Running this command will download all of the software needed for the application to run. 

### Mac Step by Step to Install:
First, ensure that you have the most up to date Python, which should be Python 3. Before begnning this process, you will want to be in the terminal and you will want to cd into the project directory.

**Step 1:** In the terminal, run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2:** Then, create a virtual environment by typing "pip install virtual env" in the terminal. 
```
pip install virtual env
```
Once this is run, create the virtual environment and activate it: 
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
**Step 3:** Next, change your directory to be loginscreen:
```
cd loginscreen/
```
While in this directory, run the server with "python3 manage.py runserver"
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
At this point, Django will print out a url in the terminal. If you go to that url, the website should be running (with an exception to the chatroom). 

**Step 4:** To run the chatroom, we need to open a second terminal. Once the second terminal is opened, cd into the project, and install "npm install express". 
```
npm install express
```
**Step 5:** Then run "node server.js" (this will activate the second server for the chat room). 
```
node server.js
```
**Step 6:** And you are done!! Take the link in the first terminal (step 3) and put it into your browser. From there, you should be able to go into the Uni-verse! When you are done, Ctrl + C to break and then type "deactivate" to deactivate the virtual environment. 

### Windows Step by Step to Install:

```
Once installed, create the virtual environment and activate it: 
```
virtualenv --python uni-versecomp446 venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
**Step 3:** Next, change your directory to be loginscreen. While in this directory, run the server with "python manage.py runserver"
